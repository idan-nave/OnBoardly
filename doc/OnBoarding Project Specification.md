### **Project Specification for Web-Based Onboarding Platform**

---

### **Overview**

The goal is to develop a web service platform for companies to manage the onboarding process of new employees, specifically for the stage after job acceptance but before the official start date. The platform will allow companies to sign up, create teams, define onboarding processes, assign those processes to teams, and track the status of each designated worker within the process stages. This project will be developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with no frameworks). It will involve server-side Java with JDBC for data persistence, following a RESTful approach to handle the communication between the backend and frontend.

---

---

### **Data Entities & SQL Database Design**

#### **Entities (Java Classes)**
- **User**: Represents a company’s admin user.
  - **Fields**: `id`, `email`, `password`, `company_id`
  
- **Company**: Represents a company that uses the platform.
  - **Fields**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `address`
  
- **Department**: Represents a department in the company.
  - **Fields**: `id`, `team_name`, `manager_id (foreign key)`, `company_id (foreign key)`
  
- **Worker**: Represents an employee who is undergoing the onboarding process.
  - **Fields**: `id`, `name`, `status`, `team_id (foreign key)`
  
- **Onboarding Process**: Represents a predefined onboarding process for new employees.
  - **Fields**: `id`, `process_name`, `company_id (foreign key)`
  
- **Stage**: Represents the stages of the onboarding process.
  - **Fields**: `id`, `stage_name`, `process_id (foreign key)`
  
#### **SQL Database** (Recommended SQL Schema: PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- **Tables**: 
  - `users (id, email, password, company_id)`
  - `companies (id, name, email, address)`
  - `teams (id, team_name, manager_id, company_id)`
  - `workers (id, name, status, team_id)`
  - `processes (id, process_name, company_id)`
  - `stages (id, stage_name, process_id)`

The relationships:
- **One-to-many**: A company can have multiple teams, and a department can have multiple workers.
- **Many-to-many**: A process can be assigned to multiple teams, and a department can have multiple processes assigned at different times.

---

### **Architecture & Components**

#### **Backend Architecture**
- **Backend Language**: **Java**
- **Persistence Layer**: **JDBC** with SQL (PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- **Controller Layer**: Implement REST API controllers to interact with the frontend.
- **JDBC Servers**: Each backend feature will have its own separate server:
  1. **Users Server**: Handles authentication and user management.
  2. **Teams Server**: Manages department data (create, edit, view).
  3. **Processes Server**: Manages onboarding process data (create, edit, view).
  4. **Companies Server**: Manages company-specific data (view, edit).

Each controller will expose **REST API routes** to manage the data and interact with the frontend.

#### **Frontend Architecture**
- **Frontend Technology**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS, no frameworks)
- **Pages**:
  - **Join Us Page**: For company registration and user creation.
  - **Company Dashboard**: A summary of teams, processes, and workers.
  - **Department Dashboard**: Detailed info for teams, their assigned process, and workers.
  - **Onboarding Processes Dashboard**: Info about processes, teams assigned to them, and designated workers.
  - **Add/Edit Forms**: Forms for adding or editing company users, teams, processes, and workers.

The frontend will make **AJAX calls** to the RESTful APIs of the backend to fetch and send data. Each page will handle displaying the data and redirecting users to the appropriate form pages for creating or updating data.

---

### **Controller Layer & RESTful API Routes**

Each backend server will expose specific REST routes to manage the data for the entities. Here are the main routes for each server:

1. **Users Server (Authentication & User Management)**
   - `POST /api/login`: Login for a company user.
   - `POST /api/signup`: Register a new company user.

2. **Teams Server**
   - `GET /api/teams`: Get all teams in the company.
   - `GET /api/department/{id}`: View department details.
   - `POST /api/department`: Create a new department.
   - `PUT /api/department/{id}`: Update department details.
   - `DELETE /api/department/{id}`: Delete a department.

3. **Processes Server**
   - `GET /api/processes`: Get all onboarding processes for a company.
   - `GET /api/process/{id}`: View details of a specific process.
   - `POST /api/process`: Create a new onboarding process.
   - `PUT /api/process/{id}`: Update an existing process.
   - `DELETE /api/process/{id}`: Delete a process.

4. **Companies Server**
   - `GET /api/companies`: View all companies using the platform.
   - `GET /api/company/{id}`: View a specific company’s data.

Each controller will handle **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** requests and will communicate with the database through JDBC.

---

### **Roles & Department Structure**

- **Department Leader (Senior Developer)**: Will oversee the entire development process, manage task delegation, and ensure deadlines are met.
- **Senior-Junior Pairs (3 Pairs)**: Each pair will be responsible for specific backend servers and frontend development tasks. The juniors will focus on frontend implementation, form development, and connecting the frontend with the API. Seniors will handle backend services, JDBC setup, REST API routes, and database management.

### **Project Folder Structure (Model-View-Controller)**

Here’s a folder structure that will allow each pair to work on their respective tasks while ensuring separation of concerns. This structure follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern:
In a traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) setup, controllers handle the application logic and interact with the models, while views are responsible for the user interface.

In your case, since you are working with a vanilla Java setup (no frameworks like Spring), servlets are essentially serving as the controllers. So instead of naming these classes UserController, TeamController, etc., we should call them UserServlet, TeamServlet, etc., since these servlets are the ones handling incoming requests (which is what the controllers would typically do in MVC).
```

```

- **Backend (Java)**:
  - **Controllers**: Will handle incoming API requests and return responses. Each pair can work on their respective controllers (one for users, teams, processes, or companies).
  Backend Controllers = Servlets. servlets are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, routing them to the appropriate service layer (where business logic is implemented), and sending back the response to the client (frontend).
  - **Models**: Represent the data entities, which can be shared across different backend components.
  Models are Java classes that represent the data entities of your application, like User.java, Department.java, Process.java, etc.
  - **Services**: Will contain the business logic, separate from the controllers. Each pair can work on implementing logic for their respective entities.

- **Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)**:
  - **Views**: Will contain the HTML pages for rendering the dashboards and forms. Each pair can work on their respective dashboard and form view files.
  - **Controllers**: Will handle frontend logic, such as making AJAX calls to the backend and processing the responses. Each pair can handle the JS logic for their specific frontend views.

### **How It All Ties Together**

Here’s how a typical flow would work:

1. **Frontend**:
   - The user interacts with the frontend (e.g., a button click to create a user).
   - A request is made to the backend via **JavaScript** (AJAX call to a servlet, like `UserServlet`).

2. **Backend (Servlet)**:
   - The **UserServlet** receives the request, parses the incoming data (e.g., user info), and calls the corresponding **service** (e.g., `UserService.createUser()`).

3. **Service Layer**:
   - The **UserService** contains the business logic to process the request (e.g., create a new user).
   - It interacts with the **model** (e.g., `User.java`) and the **DAO** to save data to the database.

4. **Database**:
   - The **DAO layer** handles the direct interaction with the database (using JDBC or other methods).

5. **Response**:
   - After processing, the servlet sends back a response (e.g., success or failure message) to the frontend.
   
6. **Frontend Updates**:
   - The frontend processes the response and updates the UI accordingly (e.g., displaying a success or failure message to the user).

---

### Conclusion

To clarify:
- **Servlets act as Controllers** in your case (handling HTTP requests).
- **Models** represent the data entities (like `User`, `Department`, `Process`).
- **Services** handle the business logic (interacting with models and performing actions like creating or updating records).
- **Frontend Controllers** (JavaScript files) handle client-side logic (AJAX requests, UI updates).

This setup follows the **MVC pattern** using servlets as controllers, and it will allow your department members to work on the specific components they are assigned while maintaining a clean architecture.

### **Example SQL Tables**

Here’s an example of the SQL schema that will be used for the database:

```sql
-- Users table (for company admins)
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    company_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(id)
);

-- Companies table
CREATE TABLE companies (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    address VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Teams table
CREATE TABLE teams (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    team_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    manager_id INT,
    company_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(id)
);

-- Workers table (employees to be onboarded)
CREATE TABLE workers (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('Not Started', 'In Progress', 'Completed') DEFAULT 'Not Started',
    team_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES teams(id)
);

-- Onboarding Processes table
CREATE TABLE processes (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    process_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    company_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(id)
);

-- Stages table (to track process stages)
CREATE TABLE stages (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    stage_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    process_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (process_id) REFERENCES processes(id)
);
```

### **Conclusion**

This project structure enables parallel development by dividing responsibilities between frontend and backend and allowing each pair of developers to work on their own isolated tasks. The wireframe guidance helps ensure that the frontend will provide a consistent user experience, and the database schema supports the core functionality of the platform.

### **Full Front-To-Back Data Flow Example**

---

### **Step 1: Front-End (HTML and JavaScript)**

This part will remain the same. The user selects a process and assigns it to a department.

```html
<!-- /frontend/views/teamDashboard.html -->
<html>
<head>
    <title>Assign Onboarding Process</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Assign Onboarding Process to Department</h2>

    <!-- Dropdown to select an onboarding process -->
    <select id="processSelect">
        <option value="1">Process 1</option>
        <option value="2">Process 2</option>
        <option value="3">Process 3</option>
    </select>

    <!-- Button to assign the selected process -->
    <button id="assignProcessBtn">Assign Process</button>

    <script src="/frontend/js/teamController.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

```js
// /frontend/js/teamController.js
document.getElementById("assignProcessBtn").addEventListener("click", function() {
    const processId = document.getElementById("processSelect").value;
    const teamId = 1; // Example department ID

    // Sending POST request to the backend API to assign the process to the department
    fetch('/assignProcess', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            teamId: teamId,
            processId: processId
        })
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        // Show success message
        alert(data.message);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        // Show error message
        console.error('Error:', error);
    });
});
```

---

### **Step 2: Java Classes for Business Logic**

Now, let's add some **Java classes** to represent the **Department** and **Process** entities, and a **TeamService** class to manage the logic.

#### **1. `Department` Class**:

This class represents a department in your system.

```java
// /backend/models/Department.java
public class Department {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private int processId; // The ID of the process assigned to this department

    // Constructor
    public Department(int id, String name, int processId) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.processId = processId;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getProcessId() {
        return processId;
    }

    public void setProcessId(int processId) {
        this.processId = processId;
    }
}
```

#### **2. `Process` Class**:

This class represents an onboarding process in your system.

```java
// /backend/models/Process.java
public class Process {
    private int id;
    private String name;

    // Constructor
    public Process(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

#### **3. `TeamService` Class**:

This class will contain the business logic for assigning a process to a department.

```java
// /backend/services/TeamService.java
import java.sql.*;

public class TeamService {
    private static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/company_db";
    private static final String DB_USER = "root";
    private static final String DB_PASS = "password";

    // Method to assign a process to a department
    public boolean assignProcessToTeam(int teamId, int processId) {
        // Create a department object (optional, depending on your business logic)
        Department department = new Department(teamId, "Department " + teamId, processId);

        // Execute the DB update
        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, DB_USER, DB_PASS)) {
            String sql = "UPDATE teams SET process_id = ? WHERE id = ?";
            try (PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {
                stmt.setInt(1, processId);
                stmt.setInt(2, teamId);
                int rowsAffected = stmt.executeUpdate();

                return rowsAffected > 0; // If rows affected > 0, the update was successful
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return false; // If an error occurs, return false
        }
    }
}
```

- The **`TeamService`** class abstracts the logic of interacting with the database. It uses the `Department` class as an object to pass data and handle business logic.
- The **`assignProcessToTeam()`** method handles the process of updating the department’s process in the database.

---

### **Step 3: Backend Servlet**

The servlet will now use the `TeamService` class to handle the logic for assigning the process to the department.

```java
// /backend/servlets/AssignProcessServlet.java
import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper; // For parsing JSON

public class AssignProcessServlet extends HttpServlet {

    // Create a TeamService instance to use the business logic
    private TeamService teamService = new TeamService();

    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        // Read the incoming JSON request body
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(request.getReader()));
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line;
        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            sb.append(line);
        }

        // Parse the JSON body using ObjectMapper (for deserialization)
        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
        AssignProcessRequest assignRequest = objectMapper.readValue(sb.toString(), AssignProcessRequest.class);

        int teamId = assignRequest.getTeamId();
        int processId = assignRequest.getProcessId();

        // Call the service to assign the process
        boolean success = teamService.assignProcessToTeam(teamId, processId);

        // Prepare and send the response
        response.setContentType("application/json");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();

        if (success) {
            out.println("{\"message\": \"Onboarding process assigned successfully\"}");
        } else {
            out.println("{\"message\": \"Failed to assign onboarding process\"}");
        }
    }
}
```

- **`AssignProcessRequest`**: This is a simple class to represent the incoming data. We use `ObjectMapper` to deserialize the JSON into this object.

```java
// /backend/models/AssignProcessRequest.java
public class AssignProcessRequest {
    private int teamId;
    private int processId;

    // Getters and Setters
    public int getTeamId() {
        return teamId;
    }

    public void setTeamId(int teamId) {
        this.teamId = teamId;
    }

    public int getProcessId() {
        return processId;
    }

    public void setProcessId(int processId) {
        this.processId = processId;
    }
}
```

### **Step 4: Database (SQL)**

The database is the same as before, with a `teams` table where the `process_id` is updated.

```sql
-- teams table in MySQL
CREATE TABLE teams (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    process_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (process_id) REFERENCES processes(id)
);
```

### **Summary of File Structure and Flow**

- **Frontend (JavaScript and HTML)**:
  - `/frontend/views/teamDashboard.html`: HTML page with dropdown and button for assigning a process.
  - `/frontend/controllers/teamController.js`: JavaScript that sends the POST request to the backend.

- **Backend (Java Classes and Servlets)**:
  - **Models**: 
    - `/backend/models/Department.java`: Department class representing a department.
    - `/backend/models/Process.java`: Process class representing an onboarding process.
    - `/backend/models/AssignProcessRequest.java`: Class representing the incoming request data.
  - **Service**: 
    - `/backend/services/TeamService.java`: Business logic for handling department-related operations (like assigning a process).
  - **Servlet**: 
    - `/backend/servlets/AssignProcessServlet.java`: Servlet that handles the HTTP POST request and uses the `TeamService` to assign a process.

- **Database**: 
  - MySQL `teams` table with a `process_id` foreign key.

---

### Conclusion

In this updated example, I've integrated the Java classes (`Department`, `Process`, `TeamService`) into the flow, abstracting the logic from the servlet and using the service layer to handle the business logic of assigning a process to a department. These Java classes provide a clean structure for your application, helping organize your code into logical components while allowing you to interact with the database via JDBC.

### **Project Presentation: Developer Onboarding Management Platform**

**Timeframe**: 7 minutes  
**Participants**: 4 seniors and 3 juniors  
Each member will cover a specific section of the project, with code snippets to demonstrate their part. 

---

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
- **Speaker**: Department Leader (Senior)
- **Overview**: 
  - Introduce the project: A platform for companies to manage the onboarding process of new employees.
  - The project will provide a system for companies to register, create teams, assign onboarding processes to those teams, and track employee status.
  - Each department member will cover their part, explaining the backend, frontend, and overall architecture.

---

### **1. Backend Architecture Overview (1 minute)**
- **Speaker**: Senior 1
- **Content**:  
  - **MVC Architecture**: We follow the **Model-View-Controller** (MVC) design pattern.
  - **Backend Layers**:
    - **Controllers (Servlets)**: Handle HTTP requests and responses.
    - **Services**: Contain business logic.
    - **Models**: Represent the data entities (User, Department, Process).
  - **Database**: Use an SQL database for data persistence, connected via JDBC.
  
**Code Snippet: UserServlet.java (Controller)**  
```java
// /backend/servlets/UserServlet.java
import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

public class UserServlet extends HttpServlet {
    private UserService userService = new UserService();

    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        // Read JSON data from the request body
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(request.getReader()));
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line;
        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            sb.append(line);
        }

        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
        User user = objectMapper.readValue(sb.toString(), User.class);

        boolean success = userService.createUser(user);

        response.setContentType("application/json");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        if (success) {
            out.println("{\"message\": \"User created successfully\"}");
        } else {
            out.println("{\"message\": \"Failed to create user\"}");
        }
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**: This servlet handles POST requests to create a new user. It reads the request body, parses it to a `User` object, calls the `UserService`, and sends a response back to the frontend.

---

### **2. Service Layer and Business Logic (1 minute)**
- **Speaker**: Senior 2
- **Content**: 
  - **Services**: Business logic is handled in the service layer, which interacts with the DAO (Data Access Object) to persist data.
  - **Example**: The `UserService` class that handles user operations like creating a user.

**Code Snippet: UserService.java (Service Layer)**  
```java
// /backend/services/UserService.java
public class UserService {
    public boolean createUser(User user) {
        // Logic to create a new user
        return UserDAO.create(user);  // This calls the DAO to interact with the database
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**: The `UserService` class contains business logic for user-related operations. Here, it uses the `UserDAO.create()` method to insert the user into the database.

---

### **3. Models and Database Interaction (1 minute)**
- **Speaker**: Junior 1
- **Content**: 
  - **Models**: Represent the entities (like `User`, `Department`, `Process`).
  - **Database Interaction**: We use JDBC to interact with the SQL database. Each model corresponds to a database table.
  
**Code Snippet: User.java (Model)**  
```java
// /backend/models/User.java
public class User {
    private String username;
    private String email;
    private String password;

    // Getters and setters
    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }

    public void setUsername(String username) {
        this.username = username;
    }
    
    // Other getters and setters...
}
```
- **Explanation**: The `User` class is a model representing the structure of the user data in the database. It has fields for `username`, `email`, and `password` (with corresponding getters and setters).

**Database Schema Example (SQL Table)**  
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

---

### **4. Frontend Dashboard and AJAX Requests (1.5 minutes)**
- **Speaker**: Junior 2
- **Content**: 
  - **Frontend**: The user interface consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - **AJAX Requests**: We use AJAX for making API calls from the frontend to the backend.
  - **Dynamic Dashboards**: Dashboards for the company, teams, and processes are rendered with the data fetched from the backend.

**Code Snippet: companyController.js (Frontend)**  
```javascript
// /frontend/controllers/companyController.js
document.getElementById("addUserBtn").addEventListener("click", function() {
    const userData = {
        username: document.getElementById("username").value,
        email: document.getElementById("email").value
    };

    fetch('/createUser', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(userData)
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        alert(data.message);  // Display success or error message
    })
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
});
```
- **Explanation**: The `companyController.js` file listens for button clicks (like `addUserBtn`), gathers user input, and sends an AJAX request to the `UserServlet` to create a new user. The response is then displayed in an alert box.

---

### **5. SQL Database Setup and DAO Layer (1 minute)**
- **Speaker**: Junior 3
- **Content**: 
  - **Database Setup**: We use an SQL database to store user, department, and process data.
  - **DAO Layer**: The DAO (Data Access Object) layer is responsible for database operations like `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete`.

**Code Snippet: UserDAO.java (DAO Layer)**  
```java
// /backend/dao/UserDAO.java
import java.sql.*;

public class UserDAO {
    private static Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
        // Database connection details
        return DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/onboarding", "username", "password");
    }

    public static boolean create(User user) {
        String sql = "INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES (?, ?, ?)";
        try (Connection conn = getConnection(); 
             PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
            stmt.setString(1, user.getUsername());
            stmt.setString(2, user.getEmail());
            stmt.setString(3, user.getPassword());
            int result = stmt.executeUpdate();
            return result > 0;
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**: The `UserDAO` class handles the interaction with the database. The `create()` method inserts a new user into the `users` table.

### Setup HTTP Server to host Front without CORS problems!

The error occurs because the **`layout.css`** file (or other resources) is not being served correctly by the Live Server, likely due to a mismatch in file paths or MIME type handling.

Here’s how to fix it:

### Steps to Fix and Run Your Project:

1. **Check File Paths**
   Ensure that the file paths in your `index.html` and imported modules (`home.js`, `layout.js`, etc.) are correct and relative to the project structure. 

   Example in `index.html`:
   ```html
   <script type="module" src="./views/home.js"></script>
   ```

   In `home.js`, imports should be relative:
   ```javascript
   import Layout from '../assets/layout/layout.js';
   import '../assets/styles/layout.css';
   ```

2. **Enable Live Server for Modules**
   Modern JavaScript modules require proper MIME types (`application/javascript`). By default, some live servers might not handle this. You need to configure the Live Server:

   - Open VSCode settings (`Ctrl + ,` or `Cmd + ,` on Mac).
   - Search for **Live Server Settings**.
   - Find the **Live Server > Settings: Advanced Custom Browser Cmd Line**.
   - Set the custom browser to something like `chrome --allow-file-access-from-files`.

   Alternatively, use a static server like `http-server` (see below).

3. **Use `http-server` (Recommended)**

   Install and run a simple static file server to properly serve your project:

   - Install **http-server** globally:
     ```bash
     npm install http-server
     sudo apt install node-http-server

     ```

   - Navigate to your project folder in the terminal:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/project
     ```

   - Start the server:
     ```bash
      http-server -c-1
     ```

   - Open the provided URL in your browser (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).

4. **Clear Cache**
   If you’ve made any corrections to file paths or server configuration, clear your browser cache to ensure it's loading the latest files.

### Additional Notes:

- If your CSS file still throws errors, verify that:
  - The file exists in the specified path.
  - There are no typos in the filenames or extensions (e.g., `layout.css` vs. `Layout.css`).
